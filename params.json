{"name":"UOSC","tagline":"The ultimate old school console","body":"# Requirements\r\n\r\nOf course this project has some requirements...\r\n\r\n  - [SDL 2.0](http://libsdl.org/)\r\n  - [SDL2_Image 2.0](http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL_image/)\r\n  - [SDL2_TTF 2.0](http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL_ttf/)\r\n  - [yaml-cpp](https://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/)\r\n  - [Boost Filesystem](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nFor detailed instructions on how to install UOSC please read the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/nathanpc/uosc/blob/master/INSTALL.md) document.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Configuring\r\n\r\nUOSC's configuration file is written in YAML, which means it's extremely human-friendly, but I decided to help you a bit to understand how to populate the file with your desired emulators. Let's start with an example and the go through it line-by-line:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n---\r\n\r\nemulators:\r\n  - id: gba\r\n    name: GameBoy Advance\r\n    icon:\r\n      x: 7\r\n      y: 4\r\n    exec: \"vba {rom}\"\r\n    roms: \"/home/nathanpc/ROMs/GameBoy/\"\r\n    ignore_ext: \".sav\"\r\n  - id: genesis\r\n    name: Sega Genesis\r\n    icon:\r\n      x: 8\r\n      y: 25\r\n    exec: \"dgen {rom}\"\r\n    roms: \"/home/nathanpc/ROMs/Genesis/\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst we have a list of the emulators that UOSC should know about. Each emulator contains the following required attributes:\r\n\r\n  - `id`: A unique identifier, which will be used internally to identify each emulator\r\n  - `name`: A descriptive name\r\n  - `icon`: This where we'll put the information about the console icon\r\n    - `x`: The row of the icon in the `assets/console.png` file\r\n    - `y`: The collumn of the icon in the `assets/console.png` file\r\n  - `exec`: The command that should be executed to launch the emulator. `{rom}` will indicate where UOSC should insert the ROM file in the command\r\n  - `roms`: Where UOSC should look to index the roms\r\n  - `ignore_ext`: This specifies which extensions UOSC should ignore (save files for example) when indexing the ROMs folder\r\n\r\n\r\n# Screenshot\r\n\r\nThis is how awesome UOSC looks like:\r\n\r\n![A very simple example](http://screencloud.net/img/screenshots/52d39c33126feec597d5c12c669567cc.png)\r\n","google":"UA-37990129-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
